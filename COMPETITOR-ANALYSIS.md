**Parent Company:** AMAGI
**Contact:** sales@amagi.io | +63-2-8567-7697
**Location:** Makati, Metro Manila

### 2.1 Why They Matter

Agimat Health is the closest direct competitor to what we're building. They are a newer entrant with a modern cloud-based approach, targeting the same Philippine market with localized features. They position themselves as "the most advanced EHR/HIS system for healthcare organizations in the Philippines and Southeast Asia."

### 2.2 Product & Features

Agimat uses a **modular "cluster" system** — hospitals subscribe to a core EHR and add modules as needed:

| Module / Cluster | Description |
|---|---|
| **Core EHR** (required base) | Electronic health records, patient management, clinical documentation |
| **Financial Management Suite** | PhilHealth eClaims v3.0, HMO LOA automation, billing & invoicing |
| **Pharmacy & Diagnostics** | Lab integration, pharmaceutical contraindication detection, drug management |
| **Staff & Workforce** | HR tools, credentialing, shift scheduling, workforce management |
| **Inventory & Supply Chain** | Stock tracking, demand forecasting, supply chain management |
| **Smart Chatbot (Kembot)** | AI-driven patient scheduling and inquiry handling |
| **Compliance & Security** | HIPAA/DPA compliance, audit trails (included in all plans) |
| **Statistics & Analytics** | Dashboards, real-time reports, performance metrics |
| **24/7 Priority Support** | Dedicated support beyond standard business hours |
| **Management Consulting** | Advisory services for healthcare operations |

### 2.3 Pricing

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| **Base (Core EHR)** | **PHP 25,000/month** (mandatory for all subscriptions) |
| **Additional modules** | Custom pricing per cluster (quote-based) |
| **Setup fee** | Free for standard remote setup & training |
| **On-site training** | One-time implementation fee if required |
| **Pricing approach** | "Consultative Profitability Review" — they analyze the hospital's operations and propose pricing based on projected ROI |

**Estimated total cost for a Level 1-2 hospital:** PHP 35,000-60,000/month (base + 2-4 modules). This is an estimate — their actual add-on pricing is not published.

- PH DOH Licensed
- PhilHealth Accredited
- SOC 2 Compliant
- Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173) compliant
- Claims HIPAA compliance

- **No queue management system** listed as a feature
- **No patient portal** mentioned prominently
- **No Tagalog/Filipino UI** mentioned
- **Modular pricing can get expensive** — a hospital needing full features may pay significantly more than our tiered approach

- Hosted on cloud infrastructure

### 3.5 Notable Customers

- **Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center (CGHMC)** — top Philippine tertiary hospital, owned by Philippine Chinese Charitable Association Inc.
- Likely other large/tertiary hospitals (not publicly listed)

### 3.6 What They Do Well

- First mover in cloud-based HIS in Philippines
- Credibility with major tertiary hospitals
- HL7 compliance (international interoperability standard)

## 9. Key Takeaways

### Agimat Health is the most direct threat

They are cloud-native, modern, Philippine-focused, and already DOH/PhilHealth certified. Their base price of PHP 25,000/month means a Level 1 hospital would pay significantly more than our PHP 8,000/month for Tier 1 or PHP 25,000/month for Tier 2 (which includes more modules than their base). However, they lack queue management, Tagalog UI, and transparent full pricing.

### MERX targets a different segment

MERX goes after large tertiary hospitals (Chinese General Hospital level). They are not a direct competitor for the Level 1-2 market we're targeting, but they could expand downmarket in the future.

### Bizbox is the incumbent to displace

With 3,000+ customers and 25+ years, they own the market — but their on-premise, expensive, legacy approach is ripe for disruption. Every Bizbox customer is a potential conversion target when their contracts come up for renewal.

### Our unique position

No competitor offers **queue management + Tagalog UI + transparent low pricing + PhilHealth eClaims 3.0** in a single cloud platform. This combination targets the largest underserved segment (Level 1-2 hospitals) with the most pressing pain points.

### Action items

- [ ] Monitor Agimat Health closely — sign up for their demo/trial if possible
- [ ] Research their actual customer base and case studies
- [ ] Identify hospitals currently using Bizbox that may be looking for alternatives
- [ ] Prioritize DOH and PhilHealth certification process for our system
- [ ] Consider adding AI chatbot capability in Phase 3 to match Agimat's Kembot
